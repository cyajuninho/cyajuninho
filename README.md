# üëã Hi there

My name is Junior Rodrigues, I am passionate about development and technology. Currently, I work at FJ Sistemas as a Full-stack Developer.
With 3 years of experience in the area, I had the opportunity to work on several impactful projects, help several professional colleagues and explore different technologies.

# üöÄ Expertise

Passionate about building robust and scalable systems, I specialize in back-end development, focusing on systems architecture, performance optimization and API integration. I have designed complex architectures, always maintaining the highest security and scalability standards.
In addition to the technical side, I assumed leadership responsibilities, guiding my team with strategic supervision and ensuring that projects were delivered efficiently.
